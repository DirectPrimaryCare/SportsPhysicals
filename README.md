# SportsPhysicals
Sports Physicals  https://integrityhealthforwellness.com/sports-physicals/  As part of our array of annual and semi-annual physicals, we provide sports physicals for kids and teens ready for another year of play and competition.  If your child plans to compete in athletics this year, we highly encourage you to schedule an appointment for a Preparticipation Physical Examination (PPE).  Certain organizations and teams have specific requirements or forms for their athletes. Check with your child’s school, coach, or club to understand the requirements for your child’s sports physical exam.   NCHSAA student-athletes can find their forms here.
